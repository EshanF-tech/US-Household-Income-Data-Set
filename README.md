Project Overview:

This project involves cleaning and normalizing a dataset containing US household income information. 
The data is stored in two primary tables: USHouseholdIncome and ushouseholdincome_statistics. 
The goal is to ensure data integrity, correct erroneous entries, remove duplicates, and standardize formats. 
This README outlines the SQL scripts used to achieve these objectives.

This project also involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing US household income information.
The aim is to derive meaningful insights about household income across various states, counties, and cities in the United States.
